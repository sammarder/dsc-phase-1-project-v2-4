# Microsoft Film Analysis

**Author**: Samuel Marder

## Overview

This project aims to analyze film data to give Microsoft an edge when they decide to make a movie for the first time. Descriptive analysis of the movie data shows how Microsoft can best use the recent past of movies to get the best return on investment when it comes to making a movie. 

## Business Problem

The primary objective of this project is to help Microsoft figure out how best to invest in a new movie. To help with this objective I broke down the data by asking what would result i nthe highest return of investment and used that to make my recommendations.

## Data

The data used is from a well known movie database called IMDB which has information regarding various aspects of movies from who directed the movie to who wrote it. The sample contains movies from the recent past

## Methods

I took the data from IMDB and coorelated it with the information on movie budgets to get the return on investment because I felt that it would be the best approach

## Results

## Conclusions

Based on these results, I would hire Andy Muschetti to direct a musical film running for about 120 to 150 minutes in length.
