## Overview

A one-paragraph overview of the project, including the business problem, data, methods, results and recommendations.

## Business Problem

Summary of the business problem you are trying to solve, and the data questions that you plan to answer in order to solve them.

***
Questions to consider:
* What are the business's pain points related to this project?
* How did you pick the data analysis question(s) that you did?
* Why are these questions important from a business perspective?
***

The primary objective of this project is to help Microsoft figure out how best to invest in a new movie. To help with this objective I broke down the data by asking what would result i nthe highest return of investment and used that to make my recommendations.

## Data

The data used is from a well known movie database called IMDB which has information regarding various aspects of movies from who directed the movie to who wrote it. The sample contains movies from the recent past

## Methods

Describe the process for analyzing or modeling the data. For Phase 1, this will be descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How did you prepare, analyze or model the data?
* Why is this approach appropriate given the data and the business problem?
***

## Results

Present your key results. For Phase 1, this will be findings from your descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How do you interpret the results?
* How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?
***

Here is an example of how to embed images from your sub-folder:
